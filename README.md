# Lyra Health
<p>Lyra Health is a leading mental health platform that connects users with high-quality care through an intuitive digital experience. I designed an enhanced user interface tailored for student-athletes and academic students, focusing on accessibility, personalization, and streamlined navigation. By optimizing user flows and reducing friction in accessing resources, my designs increased engagement and led to higher user conversion rates, making mental health support more approachable and effective.</p>

# Navdee 

<p>Navdee is a patient advocacy platform designed to streamline healthcare navigation by connecting patients and family caregivers with virtual Health Advocates. The platform simplifies appointment scheduling, insurance coordination, and healthcare decision-making, ensuring users receive personalized support throughout their medical journeys. My designs for Navdee focus on enhancing user experience by creating an intuitive, visually engaging, and accessible interface that enables seamless appointment management, insurance integration, and real-time health support. Through thoughtful UI/UX principles, I aimed to make the platform both functional and empowering, reinforcing Navdee’s mission to improve healthcare accessibility and patient advocacy.</p>

# Medzo

<p>Medzo is a community-driven platform where users share experiences, ask questions, and explore content related to medications, supplements, and wellness. I designed an intuitive social experience with interactive forums, optimized content feeds, and engagement features tested through A/B experiments. To balance monetization with user trust, I integrated sponsored content and premium memberships while maintaining transparency. I also worked on medication tracking features to support user health journeys and post-market surveillance, helping Medzo grow into a dynamic and engaging health platform.</p>
